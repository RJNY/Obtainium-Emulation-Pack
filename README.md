## FAQ

### A note about stable, beta, nightly and canary versions of the same app

You cannot install more than one version of the same app. For example: You must choose between RetroArch (stable) or RetroArch (nightly). You cannot have both.

To make things easier for beginners, I've omitted nightly, beta and canary versions where a stable
one exists.

You can manually add beta/nightly applications by using the links in the README

### How do I updated Obtainium Emulation Pack?

Same as install method. It'll update existing resources.
It will not remove any other resources you've added.

### Why do some applications say TRACK ONLY?

As the name implies, these application versions are only tracked, not pulled.
This was done because we _can't_ pull these resources, but you may still care to know when these
resources have updates so you can pull them manually. For example: NetherSX2 can't provide an APK
for legal reasons, but you'll get update notifications so you don't have to manually check or be
stuck with outdated resources.

### How do I use TRACK ONLY resources?

When you get notified of an update to your track only resource:

- visit the link to your resource
- download it manually
- in obtainium > click resource > click "Mark Updated"

### Can this break?

Yes. Absolutely it can.
Any of the scrapers that use regex can break if the application maintainers break convention.
The applications pulling from GitHub are more stable and less likely to break.

## Development & Contribution

### Contributing

You are welcome to make a PR with a contribution.

#### 1. Making changes to the pack

##### Adding / Removing Applications

To add, update or remove an application, you need to:

1. make edits to `src/applications.json`.
1. run `make release` in the root directory

#### 2. Pre-Commit

Before you commit, make sure to run `make release`.
This will:

- template the README and update the table
- update the minified json release file

After running `make release`, please check for the following:

- `obtainium-emulation-pack-latest.json` has been updated
- `README.md` has been updated.
- Does the README table generate a friendly application name? If not, see documentation for `nameOverride`
- Does the README table generate a friendly applicaation URL? If not, see documentation for `urlOverride`
- Is the application in beta? If so, please exclude it from the JSON using `meta.excludeFromExport`

### Developer Documentation

#### Meta field options

My scripts will do specific actions if specific application keys are present in the
`application.json`

| key                   | type   | default | description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| meta.exludeFromExport | bool   | false   | Excludes the app from the release export json.                                                                            |
| meta.exludeFromTable  | bool   | false   | Excludes the app from the README table.                                                                                   |
| meta.nameOverride     | string | null    | Overwrite emulator name, useful if the default name is not human friendly                                                 |
| meta.urlOverride      | string | null    | Overwrite the application preview link. If empty, the readme table will use the application scraper link as the homepage. |
