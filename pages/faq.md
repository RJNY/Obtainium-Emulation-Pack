## FAQ

### A note about stable, beta, nightly and canary versions of the same app

You cannot install more than one version of the same app. For example: You must choose between RetroArch (stable) or RetroArch (nightly). You cannot have both.

To make things easier for beginners, I've omitted nightly, beta and canary versions where a stable
one exists.

You can manually add beta/nightly applications by using the links in the README

### How do I updated Obtainium Emulation Pack?

Same as install method. It'll update existing resources.
It will not remove any other resources you've added.

### Why do some applications say TRACK ONLY?

As the name implies, these application versions are only tracked, not pulled.
This was done because we _can't_ pull these resources, but you may still care to know when these
resources have updates so you can pull them manually. For example: NetherSX2 can't provide an APK
for legal reasons, but you'll get update notifications so you don't have to manually check or be
stuck with outdated resources.

### How do I use TRACK ONLY resources?

When you get notified of an update to your track only resource:

- visit the link to your resource
- download it manually
- in obtainium > click resource > click "Mark Updated"

### Can this break?

Yes. Absolutely it can.
Any of the scrapers that use regex can break if the application maintainers break convention.
The applications pulling from GitHub are more stable and less likely to break.
